      'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.'

In fact, most things we do, habits we adopt, the things we say, happen unconsciously and in automatic pilot. What if instead of seeing our mind as an enemy, we see it as an amazing tool we can use to achieve and materialize things that you want in life. We can choose to see negativity as our enemy created by a confused, blurred mind. Because when you and your mind come into harmony, life will take a different turn.",

          " 10 years ago, I was trapped in my own head, filled with fears and insecurities that sometimes try to hunt me nowadays. Coming from a small little village with very humble beginnings and no one believing I’d make it out of there except my parents, who would’ve imagined I’d be ever traveling the world learning lots and lots by the minute, having the opportunities to understand other cultures and their practices and having such a long journey with infinite posibilites ahead. Walking along this colorful streets, surrounded by beautiful, green mountains, feeling so small and so big at the same time. Who would’ve thought, who would’ve thought. Imagination and dreams are free, the only limits lie within yourself..."
